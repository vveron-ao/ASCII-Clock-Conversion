# ASCII Clock Converter
This program uses dictionaries, for loops, while loops, and list manipulation to execute an effective ASCII clock. The input will prompt the user for 3 pieces of information: The time, clock type, and which character they want the clock digits to output in. The user also has the option of leaving the character input blank, thus printing each digit as their own number.
