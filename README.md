This code calculates four different physical equations: Reynolds Law to determine the Reynolds number for fluid flow, Bragg's Law to compute the wavelength of scattered waves, Arps' equation for the production rate of oil wells, and the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation to find the change in velocity of a rocket. Each section uses predefined variables and mathematical functions to print the calculated results for the respective equations.
